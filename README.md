About the Project: 📚
I'm using this project to study and practice NextJs (SSR), ReactJs, TypeScript and SCSS modules. Any suggestions are welcome.


Technologies Used: ☕️ ⚛️
- NextJS
- ReactJS
- TypeScript
- SCSS modules

- Wanting to implement in future: Jest and React-test-library for unit testing


Setup / Installation: 💻
Following the NextJs scripts:
- "dev": "next dev",
- "build": "next build",
- "start": "next start",
- "lint": "next lint"

- For new challenges:
  - Create a new branch from main and then create a pull request once the challenge is completed.
  - it's important to attach SS of lighthouse and axe tool reports to merge to main branch.


Approach: 🚶
- Wanted to implement SCSS Modules fo styles because Styled Components looks like is having some issues with React 18 and it was an opportunity to improve knowledge in this area.
- Since where I work we are using some projects with server side rendering with .net, wanted to use NextJs to try to emulate the scenario of my daily basis work for those projects when we don't use ReactJs.
- Typescript is a great tool to have good practices and avoid future bugs because of the strong type check it has, so wanted to improve my knowledge with it.
- Unit testing will be part of this project too, so probably will be my next step working for the challenge existent in the site.
- PWA can be taken as a desirable for a future.

Status: 📶
**Challenges:
  -- Interactive Rating Component:
    - Development: ✔
    - Axe tool: ✔ (has a serious error about contrast, but since the design if given by the website there is no fix for it)
    - Lighthouse: ✔ (pending to work in PWA for the website)

Credits: 📝
- I'd like to thanks https://www.frontendmentor.io/ for having such a great designs that inspires me to keep practicing and acquiring new knowledge.
